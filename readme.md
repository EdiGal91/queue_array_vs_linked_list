# Queue Performance Comparison

This repository contains a comparison of queue performance using two different data structures: arrays and linked lists.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the video: [Ron Klein @ Node.TLV 24` | First In Fast Out – How I developed a queue that’s faster and lighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kscC91NHpLc).

## Contents
- **ArrayQueue**: Implementation of a queue using an array.
- **LinkedListQueue**: Implementation of a queue using a linked list.
- **Performance Tests**: Scripts and results comparing the performance of the two implementations.

## Running the Project
- To run the project using the array implementation, use: `npm run start:array`
- To run the project using the linked list implementation, use: `npm run start:list`

## Performance Results
- **ArrayQueue**: Processed 1,120,000 items in 88 seconds, meaning around 13,000 items per second.
- **LinkedListQueue**: Processed 1,120,000 items in 83 milliseconds, meaning around 13,000,000 items per second.
